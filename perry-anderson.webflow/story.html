        <div class="text0 paragraph">I&#x27;ve been developing software since 1982 beginning with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20" class="link1">Commodore Vic 20</a>. The day my cousin and I walked into my school mate Bruce Culleton&#x27;s living room to see his new computer it was love at first site. Bruce showed me what he got for getting such high marks that year and I was completely fascinated with how he&#x27;d type in commands one minute and the letters and numbers and symbols danced all over the screen the next. As we walked away that afternoon, I turned to my cousin and told him &quot;I&#x27;m getting a computer&quot;. How that was going to happen I didn&#x27;t know as we never really had much money growing up but somehow I just knew!  Oddly enough a week or two later I was most fortunate to have found student summer employment painting fences and other odd jobs for the community&#x27;s recreational parks and managed to save every single <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=big+bang+theory&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1058&amp;bih=1341&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8zrHWrcDJAhXBVj4KHUqZDp4Q_AUICCgD#imgrc=U6h23AH09mvT6M%3A" target="_blank" class="link1">Penny</a><em data-new-link="true">!</em> By the end of that summer I had my own Vic 20 along with a small black and white TV and it was like I had just won the Irish Sweepstakes. The computer didn&#x27;t come with any games and there was no such thing as the Internet back in them days. So with only a vague 100+ page booklet on BASIC programming I had no choice but to slowly figure out how to write my own computer games completely from scratch. Starting out with just text games first but then peeking and poking away at it&#x27;s odd memory structures till I had full fledged graphics! That is, as far as a 5k machine could provide animated graphics. Picking up what I could from the occasional computer magazines I figured out how to write my own graphical editor then save the graphic characters to a tape drive to be loaded by the actual game. When you only had 3583 (+ 828 extra) bytes of available ram to work with you learned all about <em>&#x27;<a href="#" class="link1">architectural design issues &amp; resource management</a>&#x27;</em> real fast! Some of my classmates also were fortunate to pick up a Vic 20 and to their complete amazement I managed to give them a copy of my version of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&amp;q=pacman" class="link1">Pacman</a> for the Vic 20. It ran as slow as molasses with four monsters so you had to settle for just one but the graphics were wicked for a Vic 20! Little did I realize it then but that at the age of fifteen <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" class="link1">Bill Gates</a> was giving me a impromptu computer science degree in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC" class="link1">GW Basic</a>. By the time I reached college I was a regular terror correcting the instructors in class. That was over 30 years ago, where did the time go?</div>

            <p class="my-exp-para"><strong>Canada</strong><br>I have been developing software applications on a professional basis since 1987 with my first engineering project being a SCADA system for a <a href="http://energy.kruger.com/en/hydro/deer-lake-power/" class="link1">hydroelectric company</a> in central Newfoundland. From there I found myself taking on bigger and broader projects ranging from mere database applications (dBASE) for various <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gac.ca/wp/" class="link1">University faculties</a> to GPS navigation systems (C/C++) for clients involving the Canadian Navy training facilities in Esquimalt, B.C. and the Norwegian Ferry service compliments <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thetelegram.com/Business/2014-07-08/article-3790609/Award-winning-tech-company-disappears-from-N.L./1" class="link1">Karl Kenny</a>. <br><br>In 1992 my very first GPS programming experience started with a geosurvey firm based out of British Columbia but situated in Newfoundland principally to do work for the Hibernia Project. It was really fun writing more SCADA software for use offshore linking live satellite data with in house crafted industrial strength hardware to resolve DGPS issues. Occasionally asking my old colleague <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandywalsh" class="link1">Sandy Walsh</a> on what hardware to buy (and what hardware not to buy) for industrial applications.<br><br>In 1993 I would find myself with a company called Matrix Technologies in St. John&#x27;s, NL where I was asked to put together what was described as a <em>&#x27;Media Dissemination</em> <em>Server&#x27;</em> for a project called Think Visual as per <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-maneckjee-b808ba8" class="link1">Benoit Maneckjee&#x27;s</a> inspiration. It&#x27;s functionality was comparable to the very first commercial Internet browser known today as Netscape (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_source=firefox-com&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="link1">Firefox</a>). Everything Benoit foresaw in the Think Visual project became manifest in the very first Internet browsers Mosaic and IE.<br><br>After that I did some work for a firm specializing in ice berg forecasting and vessel navigation and dynamics under the direction of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/incoretec" class="link1">Mona El-Tahan, P Eng</a>. Working along side graduates with advanced degrees and doctorates in civil and mechanical engineering and other specialists from all over the world. I would also be asked to mentor my programming expertise in object-oriented programming and software design with work-term engineering students out of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mun.ca" class="link1">MUN</a> on a regular basis.</p>
