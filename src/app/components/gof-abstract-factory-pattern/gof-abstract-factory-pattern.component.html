The first few attempts were in Java, but now since I've made my way back to the wonderful world of C++, I am finding it simpler to implement, (but not so easy to do without the use of interfaces).

Yet, even in adding this to my blog, I was able to identify an easier method of implementing the moves() method, (of the specified interface) just by adding it here. Such that, the original attempt to implement the moves() method brought in a number of issues, (you see reflected on the first tab). Now that we have a properly defined interface, I can see how merely counting the number of FEN line entries easily meets the requirements of this interface, (as all the issues related to reading SAN Chess format are now just an option and not a requirement as far as this interface method is concerned).<br>‍<br><a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2" target="_blank">Catch2</a> is a popular C++ framework for writing test cases.<br>‍
